## üí† What is Simple-Book-Store ?<br>

‚≠ê It is a command line inventory system for a book store that uses **SQLite** to store the data in a local database file `ebookstore.db`.

‚≠ê On running , it allows the user to:

      1. Add books into the inventory
      2. Update the inventory
      3. Delete books
      4. Search for books in the inventory.  

## üí† Usage

The application is run by using:
```sh
python ebookstore.py
```

## üí† What does the original database table look like ?

‚úîÔ∏è On first start-up, the database file `ebookstore.db` will be generated containing a few preloaded books:

ID|Title|Author|Quantity
---|---|---|:---:
7001|A Tale of Two Cities|Charles Dickens|30
7002|Adventures of Tom Sawyer|J.K. Rowling|40
7003|The Merchant of Venice|Shakespeare|25
7004|The Lord of the Rings|J.R.R. Tolkien|37
7005|Alice in Wonderland|Lewis Carroll|12

* Once the program is running the user will be presented with a menu. 
* This menu is where the user selects which action they want to do.

```console
========MAIN MENU========
1. Enter book
2. Update book
3. Delete book
4. Search book
5. Show inventory
0. Exit
========SELECTION========
Selection:
```

* While in the menus of the program `-1` can be used to go back to the main menu.

## üí† Functions

This function allows the user to add a book directly to the database. 
The user will be asked to provide the title of the book, the author and the quantity they want to add to the inventory.

There can be 2 possibilities: 
      1. The book and the author (combined) does not exist in the database:
      Then the database gets updated with the entries.
      
      ```console

      It also displays that the new book has been added in the inventory.
      
      {console}
      
      2. The book already exists in the database:
      The user will be prompted either to update the quantity of that book or return back to the main menu.
